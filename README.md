# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is an implementation of an "Etch-a-Sketch" style drawing board, created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s curriculum.

## Description

The application allows users to draw on a grid of squares. Hovering over a square changes its color and opacity. Users can also customize the size of the grid.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid:** Users can specify the number of squares per side for the drawing grid (e.g., 16x16, 32x32).
- **Hover Effect:** Squares change color when the mouse pointer hovers over them.
  - The first pass over a square gives it a random RGB color.
  - Subsequent passes over the same square will make it 10% darker (reducing opacity) until it is fully black.
- **Customizable Grid Size:** A button allows the user to input a new grid size (1-100 squares per side).
